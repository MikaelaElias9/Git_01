## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

When midnight mists are creeping,      
And all the land is sleeping,      
Around me tread the mighty dead,      
And slowly pass away.      
Lo, warriors, saints, and sages,      
      
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,      
And sorry I could not travel both       
And be one traveler, long I stood      
And looked down one as far as I could       
To where it bent in the undergrowth;       
        
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,      
      Shining with all his might:      
He did his very best to make      
      The billows smooth and bright —      
And this was odd, because it was       
      The middle of the night.       
      
The moon was shining sulkily,       
      Because she thought the sun      
Had got no business to be there      
      After the day was done —      
"It's very rude of him," she said,      
      "To come and spoil the fun."      
             
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the hush of dawn's first light,       
Whispers dance on dew-kissed grass,      
A symphony of day and night,       
As shadows fade and moments pass.       
       
The trees awake, their leaves aglow,        
With secrets held in gentle sway,        
While rivers hum, their waters flow,       
In a timeless, soothing ballet.       
        
The sun ascends, a golden sphere,          
Embracing earth with tender grace,        
Each creature stirs, the world draws near,       
In this vast, enchanting space.        
       
Clouds drift like dreams across the sky,       
Painting stories in shades of blue,         
And as the world begins to sigh,         
I find my heart entwined with you.        
        
So let us wander, hand in hand,       
Through fields of hope and skies of chance,        
Together, in this wondrous land,        
Where every moment sparks romance.
