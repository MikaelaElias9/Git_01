## First Verse

When midnight mists are creeping,      
And all the land is sleeping,      
Around me tread the mighty dead,      
And slowly pass away.      
Lo, warriors, saints, and sages,

In the hush of dawn's first light,       
Whispers dance on dew-kissed grass,      
A symphony of day and night,       
As shadows fade and moments pass.       
       
The trees awake, their leaves aglow,        
With secrets held in gentle sway,        
While rivers hum, their waters flow,       
In a timeless, soothing ballet.       
        
The sun ascends, a golden sphere,          
Embracing earth with tender grace,        
Each creature stirs, the world draws near,       
In this vast, enchanting space.        
       
Clouds drift like dreams across the sky,       
Painting stories in shades of blue,         
And as the world begins to sigh,         
I find my heart entwined with you.        
        
So let us wander, hand in hand,       
Through fields of hope and skies of chance,        
Together, in this wondrous land,        
Where every moment sparks romance.
